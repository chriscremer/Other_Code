I started with viz_flow. Its using the partitioning of Real NVP. Its in 2D
Then I did viz_1D_flow, using basically the planar flow.
	However, you cant efficiently do the inverse of the function
	so you can either sample a lot and use the probs of those samples
	or you can reverse the function by using Newtons method for example
I then did planar flow in 2D, and used griddata to visualize.
